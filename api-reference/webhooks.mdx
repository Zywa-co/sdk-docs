## Set up
Please reach out to your CSR to grant access to the cozmox dashboard. In the settings,
you will be able to add a global webhook. 


## Available events
We currently offer the following webooks

For the global webhook specified, we POST the following body:

```json
{ 
    "call_id": "string", // ID to be used to fetch the call details
    "event": "string" // call_analyzed, call_started, call_ended
}
```

For `call_analyzed` you will have the following additional fields:

| Name | Description | Type |
|------|-------------|------|
| `transcript` | Full text transcript of the call | string |
| `sentiment` | Overall sentiment score of the call | string |
| `summary` | Brief summary of the call | string |
| `custom_analysis` | Array of `Analysis` objects defined on the agent level via the dashboard | `Record<string, any>`

### Analysis
Custom analysis properties are allowed to be set on an agent level that is resolved during analysis

```js
interface AgentAnalysisConfig {
    description: string // Used to prompt against the transcript
    id: string
    type: 'boolean' | 'number' | 'string'
    value: 'boolean' | 'number' | 'string' // the resolved analysis value
}
```

Example

```js
{
    id: 'require_email_follow_up',
    description: 'Require email follow up: the prospect agreed to get an email sent about the details',
    type: 'boolean',
    value: false
}
```
