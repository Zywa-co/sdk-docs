## Set up
Please reach out to your CSR to grant access to the cozmox dashboard. In the settings, you will need
to generate an API Key. This will be used against the embedding token endpoint that needs to be passed to
the embedded voice agent UI

## Usage
There are a few steps for initiating a call using the embedded agent UI:

### Install the Voice Agent UI library
We have a react library that can be used to embed the voice agent trigger. This is a private repo, so please reach out to your CSR to get it set up.
```
npm install @cozmox/agent-ui-base
```

### Generate the relay token
The relay server allows for secure communication over websocket with the voice agent. This process is abstracted for you
with the voice agent UI library. To initiate the connection, we need to generate a short lived token.

Make a `POST` request with your API Key in the `x-api-key` header to `https://api.cozmox.cloud/v1/calls/get-relay-token` with the following payload
```json
{
    "agentId": "cx_xxxxx", // from dashboard
    "extras": {
        "name": "ABC",
        "phone": "ABC", // Key value pairs of user metadata.
    }
}
```

The above returns:
```json
{
    "data": "TOKEN"
}
```

### Use the token 
Pass the token received to the UI
```jsx
import { useAgentConnection } from '@cozmox/agent-ui-base'
// Fetch the token before and pass to initialize
export const OurUI({
    token
}: {
    token: string
}) {
    const [initiateCall, status] = useAgentConnection(token)
    return (
        <div>
            status: {status}
            { status === 'ready' && <button onClick={initiateCall}>start</button>}
        </div> // Your UI
    )
}
```

The framework exposes a hook `useAgentConnection` that returns the following

| Prop | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `status` | One of 'connecting', 'ready', 'thinking', 'listening', 'completed' |
| `initiateCall` | A function to start the agent call. Must wait for 'ready' status |

UI control is passed back so you can customize to your liking

## Security
Do not embed the x-api-key on your frontend. 
Instead, create an internal API that acts as a proxy to the Cozmox API. Your internal API can take logged in user as auth so that the `extras` are passed only from the server.

If you are embedding it on public sites, tt is also recommended to set up some form of captcha, Cloudlfare Turnstile is a good option.
This way, you also get a token on page load that can be verified on the backend in internal API to reduce misuse of public facing embeddings of the agent.
